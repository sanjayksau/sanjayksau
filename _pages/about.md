I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Deshbandhu College, University of Delhi, where I teach undergraduate courses such as *Python for Data Handling* and *Data Exploration and Visualization*.
My research primarily focuses on multi-label learning with incomplete label information, a topic I explored extensively during my PhD through the development of several multi-label learning models.

More recently, I have been exploring Quantum Computing out of curiosity and interest in its potential applications to machine learning.

Before joining the University of Delhi, I worked as a Software Engineer at NEC Corporation of America and HCL Technologies India, where I was involved in enterprise storage solutions for backup and archiving, with a focus on deduplication-based systems.
