I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Deshbandhu College, University of Delhi, where I teach undergraduate courses such as *Python for Data Handling* and *Data Exploration and Visualization*.
My research primarily focuses on multi-label learning with incomplete label information, a topic I explored extensively during my PhD through the development of several multi-label learning models.

More recently, I have been exploring Generative AI and Quantum Computing out of curiosity and interest in their potential applications to real life and machine learning respectively.

Prior to entering academia, I worked as a Software Engineer at NEC Corporation of America and HCL Technologies India. My work spanned enterprise storage solutions, including deduplication-based backup and archiving systems, as well as operating system crash dumps and analysis for RAS features.

I enjoy teaching and try to support every student to the best of my ability. I aspire to master the art of making complex ideas easier to understand and helping students build confidence.
