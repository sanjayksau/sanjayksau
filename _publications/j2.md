title: "Discriminatory Label-specific Weights for Multi-label Learning with Missing Labels"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/j2
excerpt: 'This paper proposes CIMML, a class imbalance-aware multi-label learning method for missing labels that estimates label weights based on observed, absent, and unobserved frequencies, and incorporates these into a weighted loss guided by auxiliary label correlations for improved label completion and classification.'
